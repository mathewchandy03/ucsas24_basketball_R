# Basketball Analytics with R
This workshop aims to provide participants with a solid base for directing their own 
basketball analytics projects using the R programming language. 
We will review some of the R packages that are designed for acquisition of NBA data, 
creating visualizations like shot charts and assist networks, and performing statistical analyses. 
Additionally, for those whose March Madness bracket didn't perform as well as they had hoped, 
this workshop will go over some basic strategies to improve predictions for future tournaments.
