# Basketball Analytics with R
This workshop will give you a solid base for doing your own basketball analytics projects using the R programming language. 
We will review some of the R packages that can be used to analyze shot charts, assist networks, player similarities, and 
game flow / win probability charts for both the NBA and NCAA Division I basketball. Additionally, if your March Madness 
bracket didn't perform as well as you'd hoped this year, this workshop will go over some basic strategies to improve your 
predictions for next year, and how to implement these in R.
