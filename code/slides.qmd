## Four Factors


Offense:

$eFG\% = \frac{ (2PM)_T + 1.5 \times (3PM)_T }{ (2PA)_T + (3PA)_T}$

$TO = \frac{TOV_T}{POSS_T}$ 

$REB\% = \frac{OREB_T}{OREB_T + DREB_O}$

$FT$ Rate $= \frac{FTM_T}{(2PA)_T + (3PA)_T}$

# March Madness

## How many possible March Madness bracket outcomes are there?

<details closed>
<summary>Hint: how many games are there in the tournament not including the 
First Four,
and how many possible outcomes are there for each game?</summary>
Answer: $2^{63}$ or $9,223,372,036,854,775,808$
</details>

## The standard scoring of a bracket is

Round One: 1

Round Two: 2

Sweet Sixteen: 4

Elite Eight: 8

Final Four: 16

Championship: 32

A perfect bracket gets a score of 192.

## Ranking by some metric
This could be as simple as using AP rankings, or you could develop your own
metric. You can evaluate your metric based on how it performs on
past tournaments. 

## Ranking by some metric
Example:
![](../pictures/kenpom.png)


## Ranking by some metric
* We can pick the best team at each stage
* Strict hierarchy is unrealistic and one prediction for a tournament has
a lot of uncertainty

## How do we model how good a team is?

We can predict the probability of a team winning a certain March Madness game.

<details closed>
<summary>What are some models that can be used for binary
classification?</summary>
Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, Neural Network, etc.
</details>

## What are some possible features?

<details closed>
<summary></summary>
Strength of Schedule, Performance in Recent Games, 
Performance in Recent Seasons, Injuries/Suspensions, Location,
Player Matchups, Offensive/Defensive Tendencies

</details>


## "Probabilistic" approach
Depending on choice of model, it may be possible 
that the team
most likely to advance at one stage may be less likely to advance at a future 
stage.

Example:
![](../pictures/fivethirtyeight.png)


## "Probabilistic" approach
![](../pictures/bracket1.png)

* Can account for differences in playstyles
* Not practical to compute (9,223,372,036,854,775,808 different possibilities
to consider)

## How do we model how good a team is?

We can predict how many points a team will score in a March Madness game. 

<details closed>
<summary>What kind of variable can we use to model a count variable?</summary>
Poisson or Binomial, Poisson is easier because there is only one parameter.
</details>

Regression works for continuous variables that have a support of 
$(-\infty, \infty)$, so we must use a link function to map the counts to real
variables. 

## Poisson Regression

For regression, let $Y$ be the number of points scored by the team of interest,
and let $x_j$ be the $j$th predictor out of $n$.


Then $\log(E(Y | x)) = \theta_0 + \theta_1x_1 + \theta_2x_2 + ... + \theta_nx_n$

## Simulation approach

For each team in a game, we can
draw from Pois$(\lambda)$, where $\lambda$ is the predicted 
response from our regression for that team's points. The team that scores more
points advances. We can simulate a tournament as many times as we want. Then
we can get an idea of how likely a team is to make it to a certain round. Note
that the most likely bracket may not coincide with the most likely winner.

## Simulation approach
![](../pictures/bracket2.png)

## Simulation approach
* Doesn't require as much processing
* Hard to find optimal bracket

## Vibes Bracket
Pick the teams you think will win, or the teams you personally want to win.
It worked great for UConn students! Just make sure you don't pick too few or too many upsets.

## Picking Upsets
[NCAA](https://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/bracketiq/2018-03-13/heres-how-pick-march-madness-upsets-according-data)
Average Number of Upsets:

* Total Upsets: 8.5
* First Round: 4.65
* Second Round: 3.13
* Elite Eight: 0.31
* Final Four: 0.10


## The End
